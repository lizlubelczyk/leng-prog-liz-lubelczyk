# Example Project

This is an example project to test that your Rust installation is working OK

To check it:

## Change (CD) into this project Directory !!!

The project root is where the **Cargo.toml** file resides. Also you will have a couple of directories **src** and **test** where the project sources and test reside. 

## Now Try building the project and the tests

1. `cargo build` should build the project.
2. `cargo test` should run the tests without errors.

## The project contains a `main` function.

* You can run it from the command line with `cargo run` or executing the binary `target/debug/example`.
* You can also run it from the IDE
