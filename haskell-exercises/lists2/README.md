# List Exercises

## Instructions

You have to implement exercises working over lists

You have a type defined as:

```haskell
data Bit = F | T

type Bits = [Bit]
```

## 1. Convert a `Char` to `Bits`

You need to create function to convert a `Char` to a list of bits `Bits`

```haskell
> charToBits 'A'
[F,T,F,F,F,F,F,T]

> charToBits 'a'
[F,T,T,F,F,F,F,T]

> charToBits '\0'
[F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F]

```

### Hints:

You have already being provided with a function: 

`bitAt :: Int -> Char -> Bit`

That given a `Char` and an `Int` (The position of the bit) returns `T` if the bit at that offset is set 

So you can implement `charToBits` with a simple List Comprehension


##


## 2. Convert a `String` to `Bits`

Using the function defined in the previous exercise define a function `bits` to convert an `String` to a list of bits (`Bits`)

```haskell
> bits "AB"  
[F,T,F,F,F,F,F,T,F,T,F,F,F,F,T,F]
```

It is a plus if it works with infinite lists:

```haskell
> take 15 $ bits $ cycle "AB"
[F,T,F,F,F,F,F,T,F,T,F,F,F,F,T]
```

Try to use the `map` and `foldr` functions to implement it

## 4.BONUS Solve the '8' Queens problem

The eight queens problem is the problem of placing eight queens 
on an 8Ã—8 chessboard such that none of them attack one another.

You Should return a List of the solutions. Where each solution is a List of rows 
with the position of a queen in this row.

For example: `[2, 1]` means a queen in column 2 in row 1 and a queen in column 1 in row 2. 

Actually the function accepts any board size:

```haskell
> queens 4 
[[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2]]
```
